The link to the deployed app on Netlify is https://ncnewsvb.netlify.app/

This is a React app where users can browse articles, vote on them and post/delete articles under their username.

The HomePage has a list of current articles by date of latest released, and upon clicking on chosen article it takes the user to single article page where they can vote on that article and post/delete a comment.

The hardcoded username for the project was 'grumpy19' to check the post and delete functionality.

Node version v23.11.0 was used to run locally

To run the project locally git clone https://github.com/Vnb123/fe-nc-news, cd into it and use npm install in the terminal.
